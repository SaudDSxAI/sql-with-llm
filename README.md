Retail Insight Generator

The Retail Insight Generator is a Streamlit-based application that enables users to query retail data in plain English. By leveraging large language models for natural language to SQL translation, the app converts user questions into executable SQL queries, runs them against a retail database, and returns actionable insights.

With its intuitive interface, business users can type queries such as "Show me the maximum sales in the last quarter" and instantly view both the generated SQL and the corresponding results. This removes the barrier of SQL expertise and makes data exploration accessible to a wider audience.
